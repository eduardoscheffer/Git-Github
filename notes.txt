Here are some corrections to get the course right:
1) When first opening the terminal in VS Code,  on the top-right of the terminal bar just change from "Powershell" to "Git Bash" and then follow along 
2) dont use SSH link when cloning...use HTTPS link so it becomes "git clone xxxHTTPSxxx"
3) dont use "git push origin master" --> use "git push origin main" 
 because the naming convention has changed from master to main

Free and open source version controle system;

Terms:
	directory = Folder;
	CLI = command line interface;
	cd = change directory;
	repository = Project, or the folder/place where your project is kept;
	Github = website to host your repositories online;

Git Commands:
	clone = bring a repository that is hosted somewhere like github into a folder on your local machine;
	add = track your files and changes in Git;
	commit = save your files in Git;
	push = upload git commits to a remote repo, like github;
	pull = download changes from remote repo to your local machine, the opposite of push;
	status = shows all the files that were crated, updated or deleated but haven't been saved on a commot yet;
		'modified' = the git repository has been modified;
		'untracked' = git doesn't know about this file yet, first you must tell git to track the file before you can it save it to git;

> git clone https://github.com/eduardoscheffer/fibonacci.git  // bring a repository from github to your local machine;

> git status // shows all the files that were created, updated or deleated but haven't been saved on a commot yet;
	'modified' = the git repository has been modified;
	'untracked' = git doesn't know about this file yet, first you must tell git to track the file before you can it save it to git;

> git add <folder-here> // tells git to track the specific folder that was created and it's 'untracked' yet;

> git add . // tells git to track all of the files listed in the status command, both modified and untracked;

> git commit -m "Added a Readme.md and updated the fibonacci sequence" // save your file and modifications (locally), the commit isn't live on Github yet;

SSH Keys:
	In order to push the commits to github under your account you have to prove to Github that you are the owner of yout account

	Connect your local machine to your github using SSH Keys;
	Start by generating a key locally using:
		~ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "eduardoscheffer91@gmail.com"
	Connect this new key (public) to your github account;
	Configure local git to knows about the key you just generated:
		adding a new SSh Key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys:
			$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
			> Agent pid 107
			$ ssh-add ~/testkey

GIT PUSH:
	> git push origin main // uploaded git commits tu the main branch of the repo;

WHEN CRATING A REPO LOCALLY:
	> git init // initialize git repository in this current folder
	> git add .
	> git commit -m ""
	Create a repo in Github and copy the URl 
	> git remote add origin git@github.com:eduardoscheffer/repoFileName.git
	> git push origin main

Git Branching:
	> git branch // * main = you are currently on the main branch;
	> git checkout // used to switch between branches;
	> git checkout -b name-of-the-branch // create a new branch and give it a name;
	
Git Merging:
	> git diff // compare two versions of the code and shows me the changes that have been made.
	> git push --set-upstream origin name-of-the-branch // push up to github;
	Go to Github and view/comment/accept the Pull Request (PR);
	> git merge name-of-the-branch // merge the two branches (feature and main) locally;

Pull Request: // a request to have your code pulled into another branch (main)
	Getting the changes from github to your local machine:
	> get pull origin main

Remove branch after PR:
	> git branch -d name-of-the-branch

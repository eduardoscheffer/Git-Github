Here are some corrections to get the course right:
1) When first opening the terminal in VS Code,  on the top-right of the terminal bar just change from "Powershell" to "Git Bash" and then follow along 
2) dont use SSH link when cloning...use HTTPS link so it becomes "git clone xxxHTTPSxxx"
3) dont use "git push origin master" --> use "git push origin main" 
 because the naming convention has changed from master to main

		'modified' = the git repository has been modified;
		'untracked' = git doesn't know about this file yet, first you must tell git to track the file before you can it save it to git;

> git clone https://github.com/eduardoscheffer/fibonacci.git  // bring a repository from github to your local machine;

> git status // shows all the files that were created, updated or deleated but haven't been saved on a commot yet;
	'modified' = the git repository has been modified;
	'untracked' = git doesn't know about this file yet, first you must tell git to track the file before you can it save it to git;

		~ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "eduardoscheffer91@gmail.com"
	Connect this new key (public) to your github account;
	Configure local git to knows about the key you just generated:
		adding a new SSh Key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys:
			$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
			> Agent pid 107
			$ ssh-add ~/testkey

GIT PUSH:
	> git push origin main // uploaded git commits tu the main branch of the repo;

WHEN CRATING A REPO LOCALLY:
	> git init // initialize git repository in this current folder
	> git add .
	> git commit -m ""
	Create a repo in Github and copy the URl 
	> git remote add origin git@github.com:eduardoscheffer/repoFileName.git
	> git push origin main
